  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a regression equation to estimate peak power (PP) using a large sample of athletic youths and young adults. Anthropometric and vertical jump ground reaction forces were collected from 460 male volunteers (age: 12-24 years). Of these 460 volunteers, a stratified random sample of 45 subjects representing 3 different age groups (12-15 years [n = 15], 16-18 years [n = 15], and 19-24 years [n = 15]) was selected as a validation sample. Data from the remaining 415 subjects were used to develop a new equation ("Novel") to estimate PP using age, body mass (BM), and vertical jump height (VJH) via backward stepwise regression. Independently, age (r = 0.57), BM (r = 0.83), and VJ (r = 0.65) were significantly (p \textbackslash textgreater 0.05) correlated with PP. However, age did not significantly (p = 0.53) contribute to the final prediction equation (Novel): PP (watts) = 63.6 \texttimes{} VJH (centimeters) + 42.7 \texttimes{} BM (kilograms) 2 1,846.5 (r = 0.96; standard error of the estimate= 250.7 W). For each age group, there were no differences between actual PP (overall group mean {$\pm$} SD: 3,244 {$\pm$} 991 W) and PP estimated using Novel (3,253 {$\pm$} 1,037 W). Conversely, other previously published equations produced PP estimates that were significantly different than actual PP. The large sample size used in this study (n = 415) likely explains the greater accuracy of the reported Novel equation compared with previously developed equations (n = 17-161). Although this Novel equation can accurately estimate PP values for a group of subjects, between-subject comparisons estimating PP using Novel or any other previously published equations should be interpreted with caution because of large intersubject error ({$\pm$} \textbackslash textgreater 600 W) associated with predictions. \textcopyright{} 2012 National Strength and Conditioning Association.},

Twenty-four experienced resistance trained men were randomly assigned to either a block periodization training program (BP; age = 24.2 {$\pm$} 3.1 years, body mass = 78.5 {$\pm$} 11.0 kg, height = 177.6 {$\pm$} 4.9 cm) or to a traditional periodization program (TP; age = 26.2 {$\pm$} 6.0 years, body mass = 80.5 {$\pm$} 13.3 kg, height = 179.2 {$\pm$} 4.6). Participants in both training programs performed 4 training sessions per week. Each training program consisted of the same exercises and same volume of training (total resistance lifted per session). The difference between the groups was in the manipulation of training intensity within each training phase. Strength and power testing occurred before training (PRE) and after 15 weeks (POST) of training. Magnitude-based inferences were used to compare strength and power performance between the groups. Participants in BP were more likely (79.8\%) to increase the area under the force-power curve than TP. Participants in BP also demonstrated a likely positive (92.76\%) decrease in the load corresponding to maximal power at the bench press compared with TP group, and a possible improvement ({$\sim$}60\%) in maximal strength and power in the bench press. No significant changes were noted between groups in lower-body strength or jump power performance after the 15-week training period. Results of this study indicate that BP may enhance upper-body power expression to a greater extent than TP with equal volume; however, no differences were detected for lower-body performance and body composition measures.},

We summarize the intuition and methodology of Bayesian  data analysis and motivate its use for analyzing Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT).  We demonstrate the strengths of the approach through the analysis of a Cognitive  Behavioral Therapy RCT on the influence of a smartphone application on binge-eating  disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa. METHOD: We fit a multilevel Poisson regression  model on outcome variable Objective Bulimic Episodes (OBE) as a function of the  treatment and other covariates. OBE is a discrete count variable and the Poisson  model fits well. The multilevel structure accounts for individual and time-varying  effects. RESULTS: Our analysis suggests that the smartphone application causes a  reduction in the instances of OBE for patients in the initial weeks, but the effect  may wear off by the end of the treatment period. Bayesian methods allow us to obtain  heterogeneous treatment effects for different individuals and stages of the therapy  while explicitly modeling uncertainty around these effects. DISCUSSION: We conclude  that Bayesian methods are a powerful tool for incorporating data and prior  information into models.

  abstract = {This study was designed to investigate the interchangeability of 2 commercial optical timing systems for measuring flight time and contact time during jumping and hopping. Seventy-three physical education students (33 men and 40 women) participated in this study. They were instructed to perform 3 jump protocols (squat jump, countermovement jump, and countermovement jump free arms) and a hopping test (10 seconds with straight legs at a frequency of 2 Hz). Flight time and contact time were measured with 2 optical timing systems (Optojump, Microgate, Italia and IR-mat, Ergotest, Sweden), consisting of 2 bars placed opposite to each other. Both systems trigger a timer with a precision of 1 millisecond each time the infrared light is interrupted by the feet. Jump height was given by the systems, whereas leg stiffness was computed from contact time and flight time. Flight time was higher when measured with the IR-mat (bias +/- 95\% LOA [limits of agreement] = 5 +/- 14 ms, p \textbackslash textless 0.001). This difference was trivial (effect size \textbackslash textless0.2) and clinically meaningless. The high correlation between sets of data (r = 0.99) together with narrow 95\% LOA (3\%) support the interchangeability of both systems to measure flight time. Similar results were found with contact time (bias +/- 95\% LOA = 8 +/- 23 ms, p \textbackslash textless 0.001, effect size \textbackslash textless0.2 and r = 0.99), with the exception that it was the Optojump that provided the higher values. These trivial but significant differences between both systems had minor impact on jumping height (bias +/- 95\% LOA = 0.6 +/- 1.7 cm, p \textbackslash textless 0.001), effect size \textbackslash textless0.2 and r = 0.99), and stiffness (bias +/- 95\% LOA = 0.8 +/- 1.4 N.m.kg, p \textbackslash textless 0.001, effect size \textbackslash textless0.2 and r = 0.98). We concluded that both systems can be used interchangeably.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Longitudinal changes in child and adolescent active school transport (AST), and the mediating role of different intensities of daily physical activity  (PA) levels in relation to AST and physical fitness and adiposity indicators is  unclear. This study aimed to: 1) describe longitudinal changes in AST, light PA  (LPA), moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA), physical fitness and adiposity  indicators over three time-points; and 2) investigate the mediating role of LPA and  MVPA levels on associations between AST and physical fitness and adiposity  indicators over three time-points among children and adolescents. METHODS: This  longitudinal study comprised 1646 Spanish children and adolescents (48.8\% girls,  mean age 12.5\,years {$\pm$}2.5) at baseline, recruited from schools in C\'adiz and Madrid.  Mode of commuting to school was self-reported at baseline (T0, 2011-12), 1-year (T1)  and 2-year follow-up (T2). PA was assessed using accelerometers. Handgrip strength,  standing long jump and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) assessed physical fitness.  Height, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and triceps and subscapular  skinfold thickness were measured. Multilevel linear regression analyses assessed  changes in AST, PA levels, physical fitness and adiposity indicators over three  time-points (T0-T1-T2). Additionally, longitudinal path analysis (n\,=\,453; mean age  [years] 12.6\,{$\pm$}\,2.4) was used to test the mediating effects of LPA and MVPA levels on  the association between AST and physical fitness and adiposity indicators. RESULTS:  Multilevel analyses observed decreases in LPA between T0-T1 ({$\beta$}\,=\,-\,11.27; p\,{$<$}\,0.001)  and T0-T2 ({$\beta$}\,=\,-\,16.27; p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and decreases in MVPA between T0-T2 ({$\beta$}\,=\,-\,4.51;  p\,=\,0.011). Moreover, changes over time showed increases in handgrip between T0-T1  ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.78; p\,=\,0.028) and T0-T2 ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.81; p\,=\,0.046). Path analyses showed that AST  was directly positively associated with MVPA at T1 (all, {$\beta$}\,{$\approx$}\,0.33; p\,{$<$}\,0.001). MVPA  at T1 mediated associations between AST and CRF at T2 ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.20; p\,=\,0.040), but not  the other outcomes. LPA did not mediate any associations. CONCLUSIONS: Results from  longitudinal path analysis suggest that participation in more AST may help attenuate  declines in MVPA that typically occur with age and improve CRF. Therefore, we  encourage health authorities to promote AST, as a way to increase MVPA levels and  CRF among youth.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Longitudinal changes in child and adolescent active school transport (AST), and the mediating role of different intensities of daily physical activity (PA) levels in relation to AST and physical fitness and adiposity indicators is unclear. This study aimed to: 1) describe longitudinal changes in AST, light PA (LPA), moderate- to vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA), physical fitness and adiposity indicators over three time-points; and 2) investigate the mediating role of LPA and MVPA levels on associations between AST and physical fitness and adiposity indicators over three time-points among children and adolescents. METHODS: This longitudinal study comprised 1646 Spanish children and adolescents (48.8\% girls, mean age 12.5 years {$\pm$}2.5) at baseline, recruited from schools in C\'adiz and Madrid. Mode of commuting to school was self-reported at baseline (T0, 2011-12), 1-year (T1) and 2-year follow-up (T2). PA was assessed using accelerometers. Handgrip strength, standing long jump and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) assessed physical fitness. Height, weight, body mass index, waist circumference, and triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness were measured. Multilevel linear regression analyses assessed changes in AST, PA levels, physical fitness and adiposity indicators over three time-points (T0-T1-T2). Additionally, longitudinal path analysis (n = 453; mean age [years] 12.6 {$\pm$} 2.4) was used to test the mediating effects of LPA and MVPA levels on the association between AST and physical fitness and adiposity indicators. RESULTS: Multilevel analyses observed decreases in LPA between T0-T1 ({$\beta$} = - 11.27; p \textbackslash textless 0.001) and T0-T2 ({$\beta$} = - 16.27; p \textbackslash textless 0.001) and decreases in MVPA between T0-T2 ({$\beta$} = - 4.51; p = 0.011). Moreover, changes over time showed increases in handgrip between T0-T1 ({$\beta$} = 0.78; p = 0.028) and T0-T2 ({$\beta$} = 0.81; p = 0.046). Path analyses showed that AST was directly positively associated with MVPA at T1 (all, {$\beta$} {$\approx$} 0.33; p \textbackslash textless 0.001). MVPA at T1 mediated associations between AST and CRF at T2 ({$\beta$} = 0.20; p = 0.040), but not the other outcomes. LPA did not mediate any associations. CONCLUSIONS: Results from longitudinal path analysis suggest that participation in more AST may help attenuate declines in MVPA that typically occur with age and improve CRF. Therefore, we encourage health authorities to promote AST, as a way to increase MVPA levels and CRF among youth.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this investigation was to: 1) compare actual peak power (PPactual) to estimated values (PPest) derived from three different prediction equations (Sayers and Harman), 2) determine the ability of the prediction formulas to monitor change following 6 wk of plyometric training, and 3) generate a new regression model. Methods: Twenty college females (age = 20.1 {$\pm$} 1.6 yr; body mass = 65.9 {$\pm$} 8.9 kg) were randomly assigned to a control or intervention group. Pre- and posttest countermovement jump (CMJ) height and PPactual were determined simultaneously on a force platform. Body mass and maximal CMJ height were used to predict peak power. Results: All three PPest were significantly correlated to PPactual and to each other on pre (r = 0.84-0.99) and post (r = 0.88-0.99) tests. PPactual (2425.4 {$\pm$} 372.4 W) was significantly less than PPest (Sayers: SJ = 2920.8 {$\pm$} 482.6 W; CMJ = 2925.1 {$\pm$} 473.0 W) but was not different from PPest (Harman: 2585.0 {$\pm$} 409.7 W). Posttests revealed similar differences between PPactual and PPest for the intervention group, however no significant differences were observed for the control group. Mean differences from pre and posttests did not differ within or between PP est. Regression analysis determined the formula: PPest = 65.1 \texttimes{} (jump height) + 25.8 \texttimes{} (body mass) - 1413.1 (R2 = 0.92; SEE = 120.8), which slightly underestimated (0.77\%) peak power compared with PPactual in our cross-validation sample (N = 7). Conclusions: Changes in peak power is accurate using any of the regression equations; however, the new prediction formula and that of Harman seem to more precisely estimate peak power. Strict jumping technique along with simultaneous measurement of power and jump height should be used as the standard for comparison.},

Methods: A random sample of 1,068 schoolchildren (7-12 years old) representative of the region of Aragon (Spain) was selected and divided into normal-, overweight and obese groups based on previously published body mass index reference standards. Physical performance was assessed by the European physical test battery. EOPA were estimated when children performed at least 3 h per week during the previous year in addition to school physical education. Results: Overweight and obese subjects had lower performances on all tests requiring propulsion or lifting of the body mass (standing-broad jump, sit-ups, bent-arm hangs, speed shuttle run and endurance shuttle run) when compared with normal-weight counterparts (p \textbackslash textless 0.001). The overweight and obese children showed greater hand grip strength measures than the normal-weight ones (p \textbackslash textless 0.001). Plate tapping and sit reach test scores were similar in both groups. The participation in EOPA was similar in normal- and overweight or obese groups; however, a significant increase with age was observed (p \textbackslash textless 0.01). Conclusion: In this age group, overweight was not related to EOPA participation. Overweight children had poorer results on weight-bearing tasks. The good results in static strength, coordination and speed of limb movements in overweight children should be considered in the promotion of physical activity programs for overweight children.

The studies were scored according to the number of subjects, description of the study population and statistical analysis. Each study was classified as high, low and very low quality. Three levels of evidence were constructed: strong evidence, when consistent findings were observed in three or more high quality studies; moderate evidence, when consistent findings were observed in two high quality studies; and limited evidence when consistency of findings and/or the number of studies did not achieve the criteria for moderate. The results of 73 studies (50 of high quality) addressing the criterion-related validity of field-based fitness tests in children and adolescents indicate the following: that there is strong evidence indicating that the 20 m shuttle run test is a valid test to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness, that the hand-grip strength test is a valid measure of musculoskeletal fitness, that skin fold thickness and body mass index are good estimates of body composition, and that waist circumference is a valid measure to estimate central body fat. Moderate evidence was found that the 1-mile run/walk test is a valid test to estimate cardiorespiratory fitness. A large number of other field-based fitness tests presented limited evidence, mainly due to a limited number of studies (one for each test). The results of the present systematic review should be interpreted with caution due to the substantial lack of consistency in reporting and designing the existing validity studies.}

The influence of body weight on the muscular strength level across age groups was also examined. Explosive strength was assessed by the throw ball test (upper body), standing broad jump, and vertical jump tests (lower body). Upper-body muscular endurance was assessed by push ups, bent arm hang, and pull ups tests, and abdominal muscular endurance was assessed by sit ups, curl ups in 30 seconds, and curl ups tests. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Participants were categorized according to the BMI international cut-off values as underweight, normalweight, overweight, and obese. Boys had significantly better scores than girls in all the studied tests, except in the 3 upper-body muscular endurance tests in the 6- to 7-year-old group and in the push ups test in the 8- to 9-year-old group. Underweight and normalweight individuals showed similar strength levels. Both underweight and normal- weight children and adolescents had significantly higher performance than their overweight and obese counterparts in the lower-body explosive strength tests and in the push ups test in boys and bent arm hang test in both boys and girls. In conclusion, percentiles values of 9 muscular strength tests are provided. Percentiles values are of interest to identify the target population for primary prevention and to estimate the proportion of adolescents with high or low muscular strength levels. The overweight and obese groups had worse scores than their underweight and normalweight counterparts, whereas the underweight group had a similar performance to the normal- weight group.\textcopyright{} 2009 National Strength and Conditioning Association.},

Subjects: 97 876 males and 94 851 females from birth to 25 years. Main outcome measure: Body mass index (BMI, weight/ height 2). Results: The World Health Organization defines grade 2 thinness in adults as BMI \textbackslash textless17. This same cut off, applied to the six datasets at age 18 years, gave mean BMI close to a z score of-2 and 80\% of the median. Thus it matches existing criteria for wasting in children based on weight for height. For each dataset, centile curves were drawn to pass through the cut off of BMI 17 at 18 years. The resulting curves were averaged to provide age and sex specific cut-off points from 2-18 years. Similar cut offs were derived based on BMI 16 and 18.5 at 18 years, together providing definitions of thinness grades 1, 2, and 3 in children and adolescents consistent with the WHO adult definitions. Conclusions: The proposed cut-off points should help to provide internationally comparable prevalence rates of thinness in children and adolescents.}

  abstract = {During the African Humid Period (AHP), much of the modern hyperarid Saharan desert was vegetated and covered with numerous lakes. In marine sediments off northwestern Africa, the AHP is represented by markedly reduced siliciclastic sediment flux between \textbackslash textasciitilde 12.3 and 5.5 ka. Changes in the origin of this terrigenous sediment fraction can be constrained by sediment chemistry and radiogenic isotope tracers. At Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 658, Hole C (20\textdegree 44.95{${'}$}N, 18\textdegree 34.85{${'}$}W, 2263 mbsl), the neodymium (Nd) isotope composition of terrigenous detritus shows little variability throughout the last 25 kyr, indicating that the contributing geological terranes have not changed appreciably since the last glacial period. In contrast, there were large and abrupt changes in strontium (Sr) isotope ratios and chemical compositions associated with the AHP, during which 87Sr/86Sr ratios were markedly less radiogenic, and sediments show higher chemical indices of alteration. We show that sediment geochemical changes during the AHP cannot be attributed to changes in the source terranes, physical sorting, or intensity of chemical weathering. The low 87Sr/86Sr and high Sr concentrations of AHP-age samples also conflict with the interpretation of increased fine-grained, fluvially derived sediments. We propose that the most significant compositional changes at ODP 658C are due to the addition of an aluminosilicate component that has a highly altered major element signature but is enriched in soluble elements like Sr and magnesium (Mg) compared to aluminum (Al) and has low 87Sr/86Sr relative to local terrigenous source areas. We interpret these characteristics to reflect authigenic sediment supply from extensive North African paleolake basins that were prevalent during the AHP. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Research Methods and Procedures: A random sample of 3214 Flemish schoolchildren was selected and divided into an "obese" and "nonobese" group based on body mass index and sum of skinfolds. Physical fitness was assessed by the European physical fitness test battery. Physical activity was estimated by a modified version of the Baecke Questionnaire. Results: Obese subjects had inferior performances on all tests requiring propulsion or lifting of the body mass (standing-broad jump, sit-ups, bent-arm hang, speed shuttle run, and endurance shuttle run) compared with their nonobese counterparts (p \textbackslash textless 0.001). In contrast, the obese subjects showed greater strength on handgrip (p \textbackslash textless 0.001). Both groups had similar levels of leisure-time physical activity; however, nonobese boys had a higher sport index than their obese counterparts (p \textbackslash textless 0.05). Discussion: Results of this study show that obese subjects had poorer performances on weight-bearing tasks, but did not have lower scores on all fitness components. To encourage adherence to physical activity in obese youth, it is important that activities are tailored to their capabilities. Results suggest that weight-bearing activities should be limited at the start of an intervention with obese participants and alternative activities that rely more on static strength used.

Although it is very attractive to use Bayesian statistics, our personal experience has led us to believe that naively applying Bayesian methods can be dangerous for at least 3 main reasons: the potential influence of priors, misinterpretation of Bayesian features and results, and improper reporting of Bayesian results. To deal with these 3 points of potential danger, we have developed a succinct checklist: the WAMBS-checklist (When to worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of Bayesian Statistics). The purpose of the questionnaire is to describe 10 main points that should be thoroughly checked when applying Bayesian analysis. We provide an account of "when to worry" for each of these issues related to: (a) issues to check before estimating the model, (b) issues to check after estimating the model but before interpreting results, (c) understanding the influence of priors, and (d) actions to take after interpreting results. To accompany these key points of concern, we will present diagnostic tools that can be used in conjunction with the development and assessment of a Bayesian model. We also include examples of how to interpret results when "problems" in estimation arise, as well as syntax and instructions for implementation. Our aim is to stress the importance of openness and transparency of all aspects of Bayesian estimation, and it is our hope that the WAMBS questionnaire can aid in this process.},

Ninety one boys and girls aged 12-16 years performed 3 countermovement jumps (CMJ) on a force platform. Estimated peak power (PPest) was determined using the Harman et al., Sayers SJ, Sayers CMJ, and Canavan and Vescovi equations. All 4 equations were associated with actual peak power (r = 0.893-0.909, all p \textbackslash textless.01). There were significant differences between PP est using the Harman et al., Sayers SJ, and Sayers CMJ equations (p \textbackslash textless.05) and actual peak power (PPactual). ANCOVA also indicated sex and age effect for PPactual (p \textbackslash textless.01). Following a random two-thirds to one-third split of participants, an additive linear model (p =.0001) predicted PPactual (adjusted R2 =.866) from body mass and CMJ height in the two-thirds split (n = 60). An allometric model using CMJ height, body mass, and age was then developed with this sample, which predicted 88.8\% of the variance in PPactual (p \textbackslash textless.0001, adjusted R2 =.888). The regression equations were cross-validated using the one-third split sample (n = 31), evidencing a significant positive relationship (r =.910, p =.001) and no significant difference (p =.151) between PP actual and PPest using this equation. The allometric and linear models determined from this study provide accurate models to estimate peak power in children. \textcopyright{} 2013 Human Kinetics, Inc.},

One way to reduce the time required to identify and read about the research that is relevant to a particular clinical question is to read a systematic review that summarizes multiple studies. This paper explains the process that is used to conduct systematic reviews, which includes the establishment of a protocol, comprehensive searching, appraisal of the quality of the included studies, data extraction and metaanalysis, and consideration of the clinical and research implications of the findings. We also consider how the reader of a systematic review can determine whether the review is likely to provide an unbiased (believable) estimate of the treatment effect. A systematic review of randomized trials of a cardiopulmonary physical therapy intervention is used as an example. The issue of appraisal of quality is then discussed further, with a demonstration of how one validated tool for quality appraisal-the PEDro scale-can be used to evaluate a randomized trial in cardiopulmonary physical therapy.},

  abstract = {Inflammation influences cognitive development in infants and older adults, however, how inflammation may affect academic development during childhood and adolescence  remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to examine the association between  inflammatory biomarkers and academic performance in children and adolescents. A  total of 494 youth (238 girls) aged 10.6 {$\pm$} 3.4 years participated in the study. Four  inflammatory biomarkers were selected: C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6  (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} (TNF-{$\alpha$}) and white blood cell (WBC) count. An  inflammatory index was created using the above mentioned biomarkers. Academic  performance was assessed through schools records. Results showed that three of the  four inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, IL-6 and WBC) and the inflammatory index were  negatively associated with all academic indicators ({$\beta$} values ranging from -0.094 to  -0.217, all P{$<$}0.05) independent of confounders including body fat percentage.  Indeed, youth in the highest tertile of the inflammatory index had significantly  lower scores in all academic indicators compared with youth in the middle tertile  (scores ranging from -0.578 to -0.344) and in the lowest tertile (scores ranging  from -0.678 to -0.381).

  abstract = {Inflammation influences cognitive development in infants and older adults, however, how inflammation may affect academic development during childhood and adolescence remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to examine the association between inflammatory biomarkers and academic performance in children and adolescents. A total of 494 youth (238 girls) aged 10.6 {$\pm$} 3.4 years participated in the study. Four inflammatory biomarkers were selected: C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} (TNF-{$\alpha$}) and white blood cell (WBC) count. An inflammatory index was created using the above mentioned biomarkers. Academic performance was assessed through schools records. Results showed that three of the four inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, IL-6 and WBC) and the inflammatory index were negatively associated with all academic indicators ({$\beta$} values ranging from -0.094 to -0.217, all P\textbackslash textless0.05) independent of confounders including body fat percentage. Indeed, youth in the highest tertile of the inflammatory index had significantly lower scores in all academic indicators compared with youth in the middle tertile (scores ranging from -0.578 to -0.344) and in the lowest tertile (scores ranging from -0.678 to -0.381). In conclusion, inflammation may impair academic performance independently of body fat levels in youth. Our results are of importance because the consequences of childhood and adolescence inflammation tend to continue into adulthood. Lifestyle interventions in youth may be promising in reducing levels of inflammation beyond the reduction in body fat in order to achieve cognitive benefits.},

  abstract = {Prescribing the proper resistance training (RT) program is critical to optimize skeletal muscle hypertrophy and strength. Periodization is a strategy that entails planned manipulations of training variables to maximize fitness adaptations while minimizing the risk of overtraining. Multiple meta-analyses have shown periodized RT to be superior to non-periodized RT for enhancing muscular strength. These findings are consistent irrespective of training status or training volume. Both the linear model and the undulating model are effective for enhancing strength, although a greater benefit might be achieved through the undulating model. Despite the suggested superiority of periodized RT for strength development, some authors suggest that this might be a consequence of the study designs employed rather than the nature of periodized training. In addition, several limitations exist in the periodization literature, making it difficult to accurately assess the efficacy of periodized RT. With regard to enhancing skeletal muscle hypertrophy, both the undulating model and the linear model appear equally effective; however, this conclusion can only be generalized to untrained populations. When comparing periodized RT to non-periodized RT programs, the research is unclear on whether periodized RT is necessary to maximize skeletal muscle hypertrophy.},

The nationally representative sample was 1120 boys and 1146 girls, aged 15-16 years. Height and weight were self-reported. The level of PA was based on self-reported frequency and duration of sweating during organized and non-organized activity. Fitness was measured by sit-ups, sit-and-reach, five-jump, back-and-forth jumping, ball skills, coordination and endurance shuttle run tests. The fitness index was calculated as the mean of z-scores for individual tests. The prevalence of OW was 17.3\% in boys and 11.8\% in girls. The main effect of PA (in analysis of variance) on all fitness tests was significant (P{$\leq$}0.005). The main effect of OW was significant (P\textbackslash textless0.002) for all tests, except for sit-and-reach. According to linear regression models, the association between PA and fitness was stronger than that between OW and fitness. Sit-ups, endurance shuttle-run and fitness index showed the strongest association with PA (standardized {$\beta$} coefficients 0.31-0.49). OW was not associated with sit-and-reach test (coefficient 0.04) and only weakly with the ball skills test (coefficients -0.10 to -0.12). In conclusion, OW had the most negative association with cardiorespiratory and muscle endurance, and explosive power tests. \textcopyright{} 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to design and validate a vertical jump assessing system based on flight time measurements. Hence, the first phase of this study consisted of programming the software SportJumpv-1.0 and adapting a contact mat and a computer mouse in order to record the flight and contact times of a jump test. In the second phase, 9 subjects made 12 maximal and submaximal vertical single and rebound jumps. Thus 108 flight times and 36 contact times were simultaneously obtained with five different systems: ErgoJump Bosco System (PS), SportJumpv1.0 (SJ), Force Plate (FP), High-speed camera (HSC), and a Led (LED) filmed with a high-speed camera; FP was considered as the reference system. No significant differences were found either between SJ and LED, or between FP and HSC systems. SJ and LED overestimate flight time (9 ms and p \textbackslash textless 0.001 ) and underestimate contact time in respect to FP values. PS underestimates flight time regarding FP values (4 ms and p \textbackslash textless 0.01). In spite of the differences obtained between the systems, the errors found are constant. Those slightly depend on the subject's body mass for the systems that are connected to a contact mat. A high correlation between all of them was obtained (r {$\sim$} 1 and p \textbackslash textless 0.001). The SJ system was validated for an accuracy of 500 Hz, and it was shown to be a useful tool in measuring flight and contact times during jumping. The differences and correlations found between the five systems show that it is necessary to take into account which system is being used when analyzing vertical jump performance.},

We therefore aimed to: (a) evaluate the validity of existing MP estimation equations from a vertical countermovement jump (CMJ) in children and adolescents and (b) develop and validate a new MP estimation equation for use in children and adolescents. We measured peak MP (in watts) and VJH (in centimeters) during a CMJ using a force platform in 249 children and adolescents (9-17 years; 119 boys and 130 girls). We compared actual (force platform) with predicted (12 existing prediction equations) MP using repeated-measures analysis of variance and estimated bias using modified Bland-Altman plots. We developed a new prediction equation using stepwise linear regression, assessed predictive error using leave-one-out and 10-fold cross-validation, and externally validated the equation in an independent sample (n = 100). All existing prediction equations demonstrated some degree of bias, either systematic bias (mean differences ranging 178-1,377 W; 8-64\%) or bias at the extremes or interactions with sex. Our new prediction equation estimates MP from VJH and body mass: Power (W) = 54.2 \texttimes{} VJH (cm) + 34.4 \texttimes{} body mass (kg) - 1,520.4. With this new equation, there was no difference between actual and predicted MP (0\%) and negligible differences (0.2-0.9\%) in R 2 and root mean square error between our observed and cross-validated sets. Actual and predicted MP were not different in our external validation (p = 0.12). The new equation demonstrates excellent validity and can be used to predict MP from a CMJ in children and adolescents.},

  abstract = {This study compared the response of a 9-week cycling training on ventilatory efficiency under two conditions: (i) Combined with respiratory muscle training (RMT) using a new nasal restriction device (FeelBreathe) (FB group) and (ii) without RMT (Control group). Eighteen healthy elite cyclists were randomly separated into the FB group (n = 10) or Control group (n = 8). Gas exchange was measured breath by breath to measure ventilatory efficiency during an incremental test on a cycloergometer before (Pre) and after (Post) the nine weeks of training. The FB group showed higher peak power ({$\Delta$} (95\%HDI) (0.82 W/kg (0.49, 1.17)), VO(2)max (5.27 mL/kg/min (0.69, 10.83)) and VT(1) (29.3 W (1.8, 56.7)) compared to Control at Post(FINAL). The FB group showed lower values from Pre to Post(PRE) in minute ventilation (VE) (-21.0 L/min (-29.7, -11.5)), Breathing frequency (BF) (-5.1 breaths/min (-9.4, -0.9)), carbon dioxide output (VCO(2)) (-0.5 L/min (-0.7, -0.2)), respiratory equivalents for oxygen (EqO(2)) (-0.8 L/min (-2.4, 0.8)), heart rate (HR) (-5.9 beats/min (-9.2, -2.5)),, respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (-0.1 (-0.1, -0.0) and a higher value in inspiratory time (Tin) (0.05 s (0.00, 0.10)), expiratory time (Tex) (0.11 s (0.05, 0.17)) and end-tidal partial pressure of CO(2) (PETCO(2)) (0.3 mmHg (0.1, 0.6)). In conclusion, RMT using FB seems to be a new and easy alternative ergogenic tool which can be used at the same time as day-to-day training for performance enhancement.},

  abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients are characterised for presenting dyspnea, which reduces their physical capacity and tolerance to physical  exercise. The aim of this study was to analyse the effects of adding a Feel-Breathe  (FB) device for inspiratory muscle training (IMT) to an 8-week pulmonary  rehabilitation programme. Twenty patients were randomised into three groups:  breathing with FB (FBG), oronasal breathing without FB (ONBG) and control group  (CG). FBG and ONBG carried out the same training programme with resistance, strength  and respiratory exercises for 8 weeks. CG did not perform any pulmonary  rehabilitation programme. Regarding intra group differences in the value obtained in  the post-training test at the time when the maximum value in the pre-training test  was obtained (Post(PRE)), FBG obtained lower values in oxygen consumption (VO(2),  mean = -435.6 mL/min, Bayes Factor (BF(10)) {$>$} 100), minute ventilation (VE, -8.5  L/min, BF(10) = 25), respiratory rate (RR, -3.3 breaths/min, BF(10) = 2), heart rate  (HR, -13.7 beats/min, BF(10) {$>$} 100) and carbon dioxide production (VCO(2), -183.0  L/min, BF(10) = 50), and a greater value in expiratory time (Tex, 0.22 s, BF(10) =  12.5). At the maximum value recorded in the post-training test (Post(FINAL)), FBG  showed higher values in the total time of the test (T(t), 4.3 min, BF(10) = 50) and  respiratory exchange rate (RER, 0.05, BF(10) = 1.3). Regarding inter group  differences at Pre(POST), FBG obtained a greater negative increment than ONBG in the  ventilatory equivalent of CO(2) (EqCO(2), -3.8 L/min, BF(10) = 1.1) and compared to  CG in VE (-8.3 L/min, BF(10) = 3.6), VCO(2) (-215.9 L/min, BF(10) = 3.0), EqCO2  (-3.7 L/min, BF(10) = 1.1) and HR (-12.9 beats/min, BF(10) = 3.4).

The use of FB added to a pulmonary rehabilitation programme in COPD patients could  improve tolerance in the incremental exercise test and energy efficiency. However,  there is only a statically significant difference between FBG and ONBG in EqCO(2).

METHODS: Descriptive observational study in  which 756 teachers' answers on the Test of Diabetes Knowledge for Teachers (TDKT)  were analysed. Teachers from 44 educative public centres in the Puerto Real  University Hospital area (Cadiz, Spain) were selected by randomized sampling (mean  age, 44.3\,{$\pm$}\,8\,years; 61.7\% women). RESULTS: Although 43.2\% survey respondents  recognised having had or currently having children or adolescent students with T1D,  most demonstrated they did not have enough knowledge about T1D (mean score,  6.0\,{$\pm$}\,4.3 points from a maximum of 16), and only 5.1\% had sufficient knowledge  (13-16 points) to be an effective support person to students with diabetes in  school. However, the vast majority of survey respondents correctly answered  questions about symptoms (74.2\%) and hypoglycaemia treatment (85.9\%). Univariate  analysis of factors associated with teachers' knowledge about diabetes revealed that  teachers with {$\leq$}\,15\,years of teaching experience and physical education teachers had  better knowledge than their co-workers. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to improve  teachers' knowledge about diabetes in our health area with the aim of improving the  security of children and adolescent students with T1D in school centres.},

  abstract = {Countermovement and arm-swing characterize most jumping. For determination of their effects and interaction, 18 males jumped for maximal height from a force platform in all four combinations of arm-swing/no-arm-swing and countermovement/no-coun-termovement. For all jumps, vertical velocity peaked 0.03 s before and dropped 6-7\% by takeoff. Peak positive power averaged over 3,000 W, and occurred about 0.07 s before takeoff, shortly after peak vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) and just before peak vertical velocity. Both countermovement and arm-swing significantly (P \textbackslash textless 0.05) improved jump height, but arm-swing's effect was greater, enhancing peak total body center of mass (TBCM) rise both pre and posttakeoff. Countermovement only affected the post-takeoff rise. The arm-swing resulted in higher peak VGRF and peak positive power. During countermovement, the use of arms resulted in less unweighting, slower and less extensive TBCM drop, and less negative power. Countermovement increased pretakeoff jump duration by 71-76\%, increased average positive power, and yielded large positive and negative impulses. High test-retest reliability was shown for jump descriptive variables. Body weight together with peak posttakeoff TBCM rise effectively predicted peak power (multiple R2 = 0.89, standard error of estimate = 243 W). The results lend insight into which jumping techniques are most appropriate for given sports situations and indicate that a jump test can effectively be used to estimate peak power output. \textcopyright{} 1990 by the American College of Sports Medicine.},

  abstract = {Dividing training objectives into consecutive phases to gain morphological adaptations (hypertrophy phase) and neural adaptations (strength and power phases) is called strength-power periodization (SPP). These phases differ in program variables (volume, intensity, and exercise choice or type) and use stepwise intensity progression and concomitant decreasing volume, converging to peak intensity (peaking phase). Undulating periodization strategies rotate these program variables in a bi-weekly, weekly, or daily fashion. The following review addresses the effects of different short-term periodization models on strength and speed-strength both with subjects of different performance levels and with competitive athletes from different sports who use a particular periodization model during off-season, pre-season, and in-season conditioning. In most periodization studies, it is obvious that the strength endurance sessions are characterized by repetition zones (12-15 repetitions) that induce muscle hypertrophy in persons with a low performance level. Strictly speaking, when examining subjects with a low training level, many periodization studies include mainly hypertrophy sessions interspersed with heavy strength/power sessions. Studies have demonstrated equal or statistically significant higher gains in maximal strength for daily undulating periodization compared with SPP in subjects with a low to moderate performance level. The relatively short intervention period and the lack of concomitant sports conditioning call into question the practical value of these findings for competitive athletes. Possibly owing to differences in mesocycle length, conditioning programs, and program variables, competitive athletes either maintained or improved strength and/or speed-strength performance by integrating daily undulating periodization and SPP during off-season, pre-season and in-season conditioning. In high-performance sports, high-repetition strength training (\textbackslash textgreater15) should be avoided because it does not provide an adequate training stimulus for gains in muscle cross-sectional area and strength performance. High-volume circuit strength training performed over 2 years negatively affected the development of the power output and maximal strength of the upper extremities in professional rugby players. Indeed, meta-analyses and results with weightlifters, American Football players, and throwers confirm the necessity of the habitual use of {$\geq$}80\% 1 RM: (1) to improve maximal strength during the off-season and in-season in American Football, (2) to reach peak performance in maximal strength and vertical jump power during tapering in track-and-field, and (3) to produce hypertrophy and strength improvements in advanced athletes. The integration and extent of hypertrophy strength training in in-season conditioning depend on the duration of the contest period, the frequency of the contests, and the proportion of the conditioning program. Based on the literature, 72 h between hypertrophy strength training and strength-power training should be provided to allow for adequate regeneration times and therefore maximal stimulus intensities in training. This conclusion is only valid if the muscle is not trained otherwise during this regeneration phase. Thus, rotating hypertrophy and strength-power sessions in a microcycle during the season is a viable option. Comparative studies in competitive athletes who integrated strength training during pre-season conditioning confirm a tendency for gains in explosive strength and statistically significant improvements in medicine ball throw through SPP but not through daily undulating periodization. These findings indicate that to maximize the speed-strength in the short term (peaking), elite athletes should perform strength-power training twice per week. It is possible to perform a single strength-power session with the method of maximum explosive strength actions moving high-weight loads (90\% 1 repetition maximum [RM]) at least 1-2 days before competition because of the shorter regeneration times and potentiation effects. Compared with ballistic strength training (30\% 1 RM), this method has been shown to provide statistically superior gains in maximal strength, peak power, impulse size, and explosive strength during tapering in track-and-field throwers. The speed-strength performance in drop jumps of strength-trained subjects showed potentiation effects 48-148 h after a single strength-power training session. Regarding neuromuscular performance, plyometric exercises can even be performed after strength-power training on the same day if a minimum rest period of 3 h is provided.},

The independence assumption is violated when studies produce several estimates based on the same individuals or there are clusters of studies that are not independent (such as those carried out by the same investigator or laboratory). This paper provides an estimator of the covariance matrix of meta-regression coefficients that are applicable when there are clusters of internally correlated estimates. It makes no assumptions about the specific form of the sampling distributions of the effect sizes, nor does it require knowledge of the covariance structure of the dependent estimates. Moreover, this paper demonstrates that the meta-regression coefficients are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed and that the robust variance estimator is valid even when the covariates are random. The theory is asymptotic in the number of studies, but simulations suggest that the theory may yield accurate results with as few as 20-40 studies.

This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then specific to a particular treatment effect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment effect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the chi2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random effects meta-analysis to the standard error of a fixed effect meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is a transformation of (H) that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in five example data sets showing different amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Evaluating the variation in the strength of the effect across studies is a key feature of meta-analyses. This variability is reflected by measures like {$\tau$}(2) or I(2), but their clinical interpretation is not straightforward. A prediction interval is less complicated: it presents the expected range of true effects in similar studies. We aimed to show the advantages of having the prediction interval routinely reported in meta-analyses. DESIGN: We show how the prediction interval can help understand the uncertainty about whether an intervention works or not. To evaluate the implications of using this interval to interpret the results, we selected the first meta-analysis per intervention review of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Issues 2009-2013 with a dichotomous (n=2009) or continuous (n=1254) outcome, and generated 95\% prediction intervals for them. RESULTS: In 72.4\% of 479 statistically significant (random-effects p\textbackslash textless0.05) meta-analyses in the Cochrane Database 2009-2013 with heterogeneity (I(2)\textbackslash textgreater0), the 95\% prediction interval suggested that the intervention effect could be null or even be in the opposite direction. In 20.3\% of those 479 meta-analyses, the prediction interval showed that the effect could be completely opposite to the point estimate of the meta-analysis. We demonstrate also how the prediction interval can be used to calculate the probability that a new trial will show a negative effect and to improve the calculations of the power of a new trial. CONCLUSIONS: The prediction interval reflects the variation in treatment effects over different settings, including what effect is to be expected in future patients, such as the patients that a clinician is interested to treat. Prediction intervals should be routinely reported to allow more informative inferences in meta-analyses.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate hamstring extensibility in female elite soccer players. A descriptive transversal study was carried out with a sample of 75 female elite soccer players into four categories: Under12 (n=20, age: 11,42 {$\pm$} 0,90 years), Under15 (n=21, age: 13,38 {$\pm$} 1,50 years), Provincial (amateur) (n=15, age: 17,13 {$\pm$} 1,85 years), and National (professional) (n=20, age: 22,80 {$\pm$} 5,25 years). The sit and reach test (SRT) and the deep trunk flexion test were used as measurement tools. The average values showed in the SRT were 9,74 {$\pm$} 5,62 cm. for the Under12 group, 13,86 {$\pm$} 4,82 cm. for the Under15 group, 9,73 {$\pm$} 3,58 cm for the Provincial (amateur) group and 7,55 {$\pm$} 8,39 cm for the National (professional) group. In the SRT the members of Under15 group showed significantly higher results than the members of National group (p\&lt;.05), while in the deep trunk flexion test the Under12 group showed significantly higher results than the National group (p\&lt;.05). In the analysis of bivariate correlations, in the Under12 group moderate correlations were observed between height and scores in the deep trunk test (r = .561; p \&lt;.05) and SRT (r = .491; p \&lt;.05). In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the hamstring extensibility in female elite soccer players studied is limited, so we should implement stretching specific programs of the hamstring muscles in female soccer players from the lower categories to the professional categories.},

Los valores medios presentados en el SRT fueron de 9,74 {$\pm$} 5,62 cm. para el grupo Sub12, 13,86 {$\pm$} 4,82 cm. para el grupo Sub15, 9,73 {$\pm$} 3,58 cm para el grupo Provincial (amateur) y 7,55 {$\pm$} 8,39 cm para el grupo Nacional (profesional). En el SRT las participantes del grupo Sub15 obtuvieron resultados significativamente superiores que las participantes del grupo Nacional (p\&lt;.05), mientras que en la prueba FP el grupo Sub12 obtuvo resultados significativamente superiores que el grupo Nacional (p\&lt;.05). En el an\'alisis de correlaciones bivariadas, se observaron correlaciones moderadas entre la altura y los resultados en las pruebas de FP (r=.561; p\&lt;.05) y SRT (r=.491; p\&lt;.05) en el grupo Sub12. En conclusi\'on, los resultados de este estudio indican que la extensibilidad isquiosural de las jugadoras de \'elite de f\'utbol estudiadas es limitada, por lo que deber\'iamos implementar programas espec\'ificos de estiramientos de la musculatura isquiosural en futbolistas f\'eminas desde las categor\'ias inferiores hasta las categor\'ias profesionales. Abstract. The aim of this study was to evaluate hamstring extensibility in female elite soccer players. A descriptive transversal study was carried out with a sample of 75 female elite soccer players into four categories: Under12 (n=20, age: 11,42 {$\pm$} 0,90 years), Under15 (n=21, age: 13,38 {$\pm$} 1,50 years), Provincial (amateur) (n=15, age: 17,13 {$\pm$} 1,85 years), and National (professional) (n=20, age: 22,80 {$\pm$} 5,25 years). The sit and reach test (SRT) and the deep trunk flexion test were used as measurement tools. The average values showed in the SRT were 9,74 {$\pm$} 5,62 cm. for the Under12 group, 13,86 {$\pm$} 4,82 cm. for the Under15 group, 9,73 {$\pm$} 3,58 cm for the Provincial (amateur) group and 7,55 {$\pm$} 8,39 cm for the National (professional) group. In the SRT the members of Under15 group showed significantly higher results than the members of National group (p\&lt;.05), while in the deep trunk flexion test the Under12 group showed significantly higher results than the National group (p\&lt;.05). In the analysis of bivariate correlations, in the Under12 group moderate correlations were observed between height and scores in the deep trunk test (r = .561; p \&lt;.05) and SRT (r = .491; p \&lt;.05). In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the hamstring extensibility in female elite soccer players studied is limited, so we should implement stretching specific programs of the hamstring muscles in female soccer players from the lower categories to the professional categories.},

The random effects meta-regression model allows the inclusion of trial-specific covariates which may explain a part of the heterogeneity. We examine the commonly used tests on the parameters in the random effects meta-regression with one covariate and propose some new test statistics based on an improved estimator of the variance of the parameter estimates. The approximation of the distribution of the newly proposed tests is based on some theoretical considerations. Moreover, the newly proposed tests can easily be extended to the case of more than one covariate. In a simulation study, we compare the tests with regard to their actual significance level and we consider the log relative risk as the parameter of interest. Our simulation study reflects the meta-analysis of the efficacy of a vaccine for the prevention of tuberculosis originally discussed in Berkey et al. The simulation study shows that the newly proposed tests are superior to the commonly used test in holding the nominal significance level.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of jump capacity in a group of secondary school students and to develop 2 specific equations- applied to boys and girls, respectively, to estimate the jump power of secondary school students. Four hundred and fifty-six boys (age, 14.1 {$\pm$} 0.8 years; mass, 61.9 {$\pm$} 15.7 kg; height, 1.64 {$\pm$} 0.10 m) and 465 girls (age, 14.1 {$\pm$} 0.9 years; mass, 55.1 {$\pm$} 10.0 kg; height, 1.58 {$\pm$} 0.07 m), all of them secondary school students, volunteered to participate in this study. They performed a vertical jump test (Abalakov) on a force platform, and jump height and peak power were measured. Most importantly, peak power was also estimated through a series of previously established power equations. For the purpose of establishing statistically significant differences, a p value \# 0.05 was fixed. The equations proposed by Canavan and Vesconvi, and Harman were the most precise with respect to actual power, reaching a percentage of 1.9-2.1 and 3.6-4.1\%, respectively. The equations by Sayers and Lara showed a greater difference in percentage (9.9-12.4 and 22.4-24.2\%, respectively) with that of actual power. Similar results were not obtained in other studies, which means that a specific equation will be required according to the characteristics of the assessed sample. Two equations specifically addressed to secondary school students will be established in this article: boys: ([61.8 jump height (cm)] + [37.1 body mass (kg)] -1,941.6); girls: ([31 jump height (cm)] + [45 body mass (kg)]-1,045.4).Crossvalidation tests that were done to prove the validity of said equations showed positive results. Practical applications: Those teachers who wish to estimate the jump power of their pupils can use these equations and thereby calculate jump power by the indirect method from jump height and body mass index, without any need to use any expensive tools. \textcopyright{} 2011 National Strength and Conditioning Association.},

Our study aimed: 1) to describe the jump performance in a population of male applicants to a Faculty of Sports Sciences, 2) to apply different power equations from the literature to assess their accuracy, and 3) to develop a new regression equation from this population. Methods. The push off phases of the counter-movement jumps (CMJ) on a force platform of 161 applicants (age: 19{$\pm$}2.9 years; weight: 70.4{$\pm$}8.3 kg) to a Spanish Faculty of Sports Sciences were recorded and subsequently analyzed. Their hands had to be placed on the hips and the knee angle during the counter movement was not controlled. Each subject had 2 trials to reach a minimum of 29 cm of jump height, and when 2 jumps were performed the best trial was analyzed. Multiple regression analysis was performed to develop a new regression equation. Results. Mean jump height was 34.6{$\pm$}4.3 cm, peak vertical force 1 663.9{$\pm$}291.1 N and peak power 3524.4{$\pm$}562 W. All the equations underestimated power, from 74\% (Lewis) to 8\% (Sayers). However, there were high and significant correlations between peak power measured on the force platform, and those assessed by the equations. Conclusions. The results of the present study support the development of power equations for specific populations, to achieve more accurate assessments. The power equation from this study [Power=(62.5 \texttimes{} jump height (cm)) + (50.3 \texttimes{} body mass (kg)) - 2 184.7] can be used accurately in populations of male physical education students.},

The results contribute to  the development of an intuitive understanding of the values that researchers report,  allowing to draw sensible recommendations for Bayesian statistics description,  critical for the standardization of scientific reporting.},

Bayesian methods are not necessarily the only remedy against incorrect interpretations or wrong conclusions, but there is an increasing agreement that they are one of the keys to avoid such fallacies. Nevertheless, its flexible nature is its power and weakness, for there is no agreement about what indices of "significance" should be computed or reported. This lack of a consensual index or guidelines, such as the frequentist p-value, further contributes to the unnecessary opacity that many non-familiar readers perceive in Bayesian statistics. Thus, this study describes and compares several Bayesian indices, provide intuitive visual representation of their "behavior" in relationship with common sources of variance such as sample size, magnitude of effects and also frequentist significance. The results contribute to the development of an intuitive understanding of the values that researchers report, allowing to draw sensible recommendations for Bayesian statistics description, critical for the standardization of scientific reporting.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to validate a new instrumented insole called ECnsole for measuring flight time during vertical jump performance. 66 participants performed 3 different jump tests (squat jump, countermovement jump and Abalakov jump) twice with flight times determined using an instrumented insole composed of 4 pressure sensors (PreECnsole) and an accelerometer sensor (AccECnsole), a laser platform (Sport Jump System Pro), and a high-speed motion capture system (HSC); the latter 2 systems are considered as reference methods. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), simple linear regression, and the Bland-Altman method were used to assess validity. Regardless of the jump test performed, the ECnsole system showed a systematic bias close to 0 and a low random error (average random error: {$\pm$}2.8 cm; {$\pm$}3.1 cm PreECnsole and AccECnsole vs. HSC system respectively and {$\pm$} 2.3 cm; {$\pm$}2.9 cm PreECnsole and AccECnsole vs. SJS system respectively). The associations between PreECnsole and AccECnsole with the HSC were very high (R2=0.967 and 0.958 respectively). Furthermore, the associations between PreECnsole and AccECnsole with the SJS were very high (R2=0.978 and 0.966 respectively) as well. Therefore, the ECnsole system can be considered an alternative method for measuring jump height during vertical jump performance.},

Nine physically active men attended 4 separate testing sessions over a 2-week period. Force platform recordings of peak force, peak rate of force development (pRFD), average rate of force development, takeoff velocity, average power, and peak power were obtained for each jump. During each of the 4 testing sessions, 3 jumps were performed under each of the load conditions. The average of the force variables were used in the analysis. Familiarization was assessed using the scores obtained during the 4 separate testing sessions. Reliability was assessed by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and coefficient of variation (CV) associated with the force variables. No significant differences (p \textbackslash textgreater 0.05) were obtained between the testing sessions for any of the force variables. With the exception of pRFD, the force variables showed reasonably good levels of test-retest reliability (ICC range: 0.75-0.99; CV range: 1.2-7.6\%). High levels of reliability can be achieved in a variety of force variables without the need for familiarization sessions when performing SJ under unloaded conditions and with loads of 30 and 60\% of 1RM squat with physically active men. \textcopyright{} 2005 National Strength \& Conditioning Association.},

The aim of this survey is to describe the quantity and quality of randomised controlled trials and the quantity of systematic reviews relevant to physiotherapy. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) was searched. The quality of trials was assessed with the PEDro scale. The search identified a total of 2,376 randomised controlled trials and 332 systematic reviews. The first trial was published in 1955 and the first review was published in 1982. Since that time, the number of trials and reviews has grown exponentially. The mean PEDro quality score has increased from 2.8 in trials published between 1955 and 1959 to 5.0 for trials published between 1995 and 1999. There is a substantial body of evidence about the effects of physiotherapy. However, there remains scope for improvements in the quality of the conduct and reporting of clinical trials.},

We examined the individual and combined associations of CRF and BMI with  clustered CVD risk factors, and the mediator role of BMI in the association between  CRF and clustered CVD risk factors in children and adolescents. METHODS: 237  children (111 girls) and 260 adolescents (120 girls) were included in this  cross-sectional study. Height and weight were assessed and BMI was calculated. A CVD  risk factor index (CVDRF-I) was computed from: waist circumference, systolic blood  pressure, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and glucose. CRF was  assessed using the 20-m shuttle run test. Regression analysis, analysis of  covariance and mediation analysis (Baron and Kenny procedures) were used to test the  independent and combined effect of CRF and BMI on CVDRF-I, and to test mediation  hypothesis, respectively. RESULTS: CRF was negatively associated with CVDRF-I (all  P\,{$<$}\,0.05); however, after adjusting for BMI the associations were no longer  significant in children and adolescents of both sex groups. Contrary, the  association between BMI and CVDRF-I was independent of CRF (all P\,{$<$}\,0.001). The  effect of CRF on CVDRF-I was mediated by BMI. The percentage of the total effect of  CRF on CVDRF-I mediated by BMI for boys and girls children and boys and girls  adolescents were 79.5\%, 100\%, 81.2\% and 55.7\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: BMI is an  independent predictor of CVDRF-I and a mediator of the association between CRF and  CVDRF-I in children and adolescents. These results help to clarify the associations  between CRF, weight status and cardiovascular health, suggesting that future CVD  health would benefit from maintaining an optimal weight status.},

STUDY  DESIGN: In total, 239 children (113 girls) and 270 adolescents (128 girls)  participated in this cross-sectional study. Height and weight were assessed, and BMI  was calculated. A cardiovascular disease risk factors index (CVDRF-I) was created  from the combination of the following variables: waist circumference, systolic blood  pressure, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose. Handgrip  strength/weight and standing long jump tests were used to assess muscular fitness. A  muscular fitness index was computed from the combination of both tests. RESULTS:  Muscular fitness index was associated with CVDRF-I in children of both sexes and  adolescent boys; however, these associations disappeared after accounting for BMI.  BMI was associated with CVDRF-I in both children and adolescents, even after  adjusting for muscular fitness (all P\,{$<$}\,.001). In male and female children and in  adolescent boys, the association between muscular fitness and CVDRF-I was mediated  by BMI (all P\,{$<$}\,.001). Because there was no association between muscular fitness and  CVDRF-I in adolescent girls, the mediation hypothesis was discarded. CONCLUSIONS:  BMI is an independent predictor of CVDRF-I in children and adolescents of both  sexes. Conversely, the effect of muscular fitness on CVDRF-I seems to be fully  mediated by BMI levels in male and female children and in adolescent boys.},

A cardiovascular disease risk factors index (CVDRF-I) was created from the combination of the following variables: waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose. Handgrip strength/weight and standing long jump tests were used to assess muscular fitness. A muscular fitness index was computed from the combination of both tests. RESULTS: Muscular fitness index was associated with CVDRF-I in children of both sexes and adolescent boys; however, these associations disappeared after accounting for BMI. BMI was associated with CVDRF-I in both children and adolescents, even after adjusting for muscular fitness (all P \textbackslash textless .001). In male and female children and in adolescent boys, the association between muscular fitness and CVDRF-I was mediated by BMI (all P \textbackslash textless .001). Because there was no association between muscular fitness and CVDRF-I in adolescent girls, the mediation hypothesis was discarded. CONCLUSIONS: BMI is an independent predictor of CVDRF-I in children and adolescents of both sexes. Conversely, the effect of muscular fitness on CVDRF-I seems to be fully mediated by BMI levels in male and female children and in adolescent boys.},

  abstract = {The present study summarises the work developed by the ALPHA (Assessing Levels of Physical Activity) study and describes the procedures followed to select the tests included in the ALPHA health-related fitness test battery for children and adolescents. The authors reviewed physical fitness and health in youth findings from cross-sectional studies. The authors also performed three systematic reviews dealing with (1) the predictive validity of health-related fitness, (2) the criterion validity of field-based fitness tests and (3) the reliability of field-based fitness tests in youth. The authors also carried out 11-methodological studies to determine the criterion validity and the reliability of several field-based fitness tests for youth. Finally, the authors performed a study in the school setting to examine the reliability, feasibility and safety of the selected tests. The selected fitness tests were (1) the 20 m shuttle run test to assess cardiorespiratory fitness; (2) the handgrip strength and (3) standing broad jump to assess musculoskeletal fitness, and (4) body mass index, (5) skinfold thickness and (5) waist circumference to assess body composition. When there are time limits, the authors propose the high-priority ALPHA health-related fitness test battery, which comprises all the evidence-based fitness tests except the measurement of the skinfold thickness. The time required to administer this battery to a group of 20 youth by one physical education teacher is less than 2 h. In conclusion, the ALPHA fitness tests battery is valid, reliable, feasible and safe for the assessment of health-related physical fitness in children and adolescents to be used for health monitoring purposes at population level.}

Physical fitness-related components were: cardiorespiratory fitness, musculoskeletal fitness, motor fitness and body composition. Adiposity was considered as both exposure and outcome. The results of 42 studies reporting the predictive validity of health-related physical fitness for CVD risk factors, events and syndromes as well as the results of five studies reporting the predictive validity of physical fitness for low back pain in children and adolescents were summarised. Strong evidence was found indicating that higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness in childhood and adolescence are associated with a healthier cardiovascular profile later in life. Muscular strength improvements from childhood to adolescence are negatively associated with changes in overall adiposity. A healthier body composition in childhood and adolescence is associated with a healthier cardiovascular profile later in life and with a lower risk of death. The evidence was moderate for the association between changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and CVD risk factors, and between cardiorespiratory fitness and the risk of developing the metabolic syndrome and arterial stiffness. Moderate evidence on the lack of a relationship between body composition and low back pain was found. Due to a limited number of studies, inconclusive evidence emerged for a relationship between muscular strength or motor fitness and CVD risk factors, and between flexibility and low back pain.}

  abstract = {The vertical jump-and-reach score is used as a component in the estimation of peak mechanical power in two equations put forth by Lewis and Harman et al. Purpose: The purpose of the present study was to: 1) cross- validate the two equations using the vertical jump-and-reach test, 2) develop a more accurate equation from a large heterogeneous population, 3) analyze gender differences and jump protocols, and 4) assess Predicted Residual Sum of Squares (PRESS) as a cross-validation procedure. Methods: One hundred eight college-age male and female athletes and nonathletes were tested on a force platform. They performed three maximal effort vertical jumps each of the squat jump (S J) and countermovement jump (CMJ) while simultaneously performing the vertical jump-and-reach test. Regression analysis was used to predict peak power from body mass and vertical jump height. Results: SJ data yielded a better power prediction equation than did CMJ data because of the greater variability in CMJ technique. The following equation was derived from SJ data: Peak Power (W) = 60.7 x (jump height [cm]) + 45.3 X (body mass [kg]) - 2055. This equation revealed greater accuracy than either the Lewis or previous Harman et al. equations and underestimated peak power by less than 1\%, with a SEE of 355.0 W using SJ protocol. The use of one equation for both males and females resulted in only a slight (5\% of power output) difference between genders. Using CMJ data in the SJ-derived equation resulted in only a 2.7\% overestimation of peak power. Cross-validation of regression equations using PRESS reveals accurate and reliable R2 and SEE values. Conclusions: The SJ equation is a slightly more accurate equation than that derived from CMJ data. This equation should be used in the determination of peak power in place of the formulas developed by both Harman et al. and Lewis. Separate equations for males and females are unnecessary.},

Specifically, the theory postulates that heavy load training optimizes increases maximal strength, moderate load training optimizes increases muscle hypertrophy, and low-load training optimizes increases local muscular endurance. However, despite the widespread acceptance of this theory, current research fails to support some of its underlying presumptions. Based on the emerging evidence, we propose a new paradigm whereby muscular adaptations can be obtained, and in some cases optimized, across a wide spectrum of loading zones. The nuances and implications of this paradigm are discussed herein.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The extent to which physical fitness (PF) attenuates or modifies the association between physical activity (PA) and clustered metabolic  syndrome risk factors (CMetSRF) is controversial. We aimed: i) To examine the  independent and combined association of objectively measured PA and PF with CMetSRF  in children and adolescents; ii) To test the mediating effect of PF in the  association of PA with CMetSRF. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 226 children and 256  adolescents participated. Levels of PA (light, moderate, vigorous and  moderate-to-vigorous [MVPA]) and PF were measured by accelerometry and ALPHA  battery, respectively. Cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness values were combined  in a global PF variable. A CMetSRF was computed by assessing the following  variables: waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein  cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose. In children, the highest vigorous PA  ({$\beta~$}=~-0.193; P~=~0.003) and MVPA ({$\beta~$}=~-0.149; P~=~0.025) were individually  associated with lower CMetSRF, but these associations were not independent of global  PF. In adolescents, the association of moderate ({$\beta~$}=~-0.123; P~=~0.046) and MVPA  ({$\beta~$}=~-0.147; P~=~0.024) with CMetSRF was independent of PF. Among unfit adolescents,  the higher time they spent in MVPA the lower CMetSRF levels were found (P~=~0.032).  CONCLUSIONS: The results are suggestive of a full mediation of global PF in the  association of MVPA and vigorous PA with CMetSRF in children. In adolescents, the  association of higher moderate and MVPA with lower CMetSRF was independent of levels  of PF, and mediation analyses suggest only a partial mediation of global PF in the  association of MVPA with CMetSRF.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The extent to which physical fitness (PF) attenuates or modifies the association between physical activity (PA) and clustered metabolic syndrome risk factors (CMetSRF) is controversial. We aimed: i) To examine the independent and combined association of objectively measured PA and PF with CMetSRF in children and adolescents; ii) To test the mediating effect of PF in the association of PA with CMetSRF. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 226 children and 256 adolescents participated. Levels of PA (light, moderate, vigorous and moderate-to-vigorous [MVPA]) and PF were measured by accelerometry and ALPHA battery, respectively. Cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness values were combined in a global PF variable. A CMetSRF was computed by assessing the following variables: waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose. In children, the highest vigorous PA ({$\beta$} = -0.193; P = 0.003) and MVPA ({$\beta$} = -0.149; P = 0.025) were individually associated with lower CMetSRF, but these associations were not independent of global PF. In adolescents, the association of moderate ({$\beta$} = -0.123; P = 0.046) and MVPA ({$\beta$} = -0.147; P = 0.024) with CMetSRF was independent of PF. Among unfit adolescents, the higher time they spent in MVPA the lower CMetSRF levels were found (P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: The results are suggestive of a full mediation of global PF in the association of MVPA and vigorous PA with CMetSRF in children. In adolescents, the association of higher moderate and MVPA with lower CMetSRF was independent of levels of PF, and mediation analyses suggest only a partial mediation of global PF in the association of MVPA with CMetSRF.},

Therefore, the leg power measurement may help athletes, coaches, athletic trainers, and rehabilitation specialists in selecting, treating, and training athletes for a specific sport. Using a conventional 'jump and reach' test, one can accurately predict the leg power and success in anaerobic-type sports. Nineteen untrained male subjects performed 'jump and reach' vertical jumps on a force platform. Power values were calculated from the force versus time data obtained from the force platform. A regression equation was obtained to predict the power values using the weight of an individual and the 'jump and reach' height as independent variables. The regression equation is given by p = -666.3 + 14.74 [Mass (kg)] + 1925.72 [Height (m)]; [R-square = 0.69, p \textbackslash textless 0.05].},

  abstract = {This review discusses previous literature that has examined the influence of muscular strength on various factors associated with athletic performance and the benefits of achieving greater muscular strength. Greater muscular strength is strongly associated with improved force-time characteristics that contribute to an athlete's overall performance. Much research supports the notion that greater muscular strength can enhance the ability to perform general sport skills such as jumping, sprinting, and change of direction tasks. Further research indicates that stronger athletes produce superior performances during sport specific tasks. Greater muscular strength allows an individual to potentiate earlier and to a greater extent, but also decreases the risk of injury. Sport scientists and practitioners may monitor an individual's strength characteristics using isometric, dynamic, and reactive strength tests and variables. Relative strength may be classified into strength deficit, strength association, or strength reserve phases. The phase an individual falls into may directly affect their level of performance or training emphasis. Based on the extant literature, it appears that there may be no substitute for greater muscular strength when it comes to improving an individual's performance across a wide range of both general and sport specific skills while simultaneously reducing their risk of injury when performing these skills. Therefore, sport scientists and practitioners should implement long-term training strategies that promote the greatest muscular strength within the required context of each sport/event. Future research should examine how force-time characteristics, general and specific sport skills, potentiation ability, and injury rates change as individuals transition from certain standards or the suggested phases of strength to another.},

  abstract = {This review covers underlying physiological characteristics and training considerations that may affect muscular strength including improving maximal force expression and time-limited force expression. Strength is underpinned by a combination of morphological and neural factors including muscle cross-sectional area and architecture, musculotendinous stiffness, motor unit recruitment, rate coding, motor unit synchronization, and neuromuscular inhibition. Although single- and multi-targeted block periodization models may produce the greatest strength-power benefits, concepts within each model must be considered within the limitations of the sport, athletes, and schedules. Bilateral training, eccentric training and accentuated eccentric loading, and variable resistance training may produce the greatest comprehensive strength adaptations. Bodyweight exercise, isolation exercises, plyometric exercise, unilateral exercise, and kettlebell training may be limited in their potential to improve maximal strength but are still relevant to strength development by challenging time-limited force expression and differentially challenging motor demands. Training to failure may not be necessary to improve maximum muscular strength and is likely not necessary for maximum gains in strength. Indeed, programming that combines heavy and light loads may improve strength and underpin other strength-power characteristics. Multiple sets appear to produce superior training benefits compared to single sets; however, an athlete's training status and the dose-response relationship must be considered. While 2- to 5-min interset rest intervals may produce the greatest strength-power benefits, rest interval length may vary based an athlete's training age, fiber type, and genetics. Weaker athletes should focus on developing strength before emphasizing power-type training. Stronger athletes may begin to emphasize power-type training while maintaining/improving their strength. Future research should investigate how best to implement accentuated eccentric loading and variable resistance training and examine how initial strength affects an athlete's ability to improve their performance following various training methods.},

A physical activity score (PAS) was computed for each child from a 2-day observation period. A physical working capacity index from cycle ergometry (PWC17g) was the measure of CVF. Low and high adiposity samples were classified by a median split (42.9 mm) on the sum of three skinfold measures (tricep, suprailiac, subscapula). For the high adiposity sample, PAS, age, BMI, and gender were significant and the overall model was significant (p \textbackslash textless. 001), accounting for 38\% of variance in PWCm. In the low adiposity sample, gender (p \textbackslash textless.04) was significantly related to CVF, but the overall model was not significant (p \textbackslash textless.35). PAS, thus, was a significant predictor of CVF among the high adiposity children, but not the low adiposity children. Mechanisms that may account for this difference include greater work for equal activity among the obese, a ceiling effect on CVF among the low adiposity children, or differences in hormonal or metabolic factors mediating the aclivity-CVF relationship. \textcopyright{} 1991 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To examine the temporal trends of accelerometer-based total daily sedentary time (ST) and self-reported domain-specific sedentary behavior (SB) on weekdays and  weekends in Spanish children. Method: A total of 560 (50.53\% girls) children (4th  graders) in 2011/12 from 23 Spanish schools and 462 (48.70\% girls) children (4th  graders) in 2017/18 from 19 schools across Cadiz participated. Hip-worn  accelerometers and questionnaires were used to assess total daily ST and  self-reported time in SB modalities, respectively. Results: The objectively measured  total daily ST tended to increase in boys on weekdays and weekends. Time spent  watching television (TV) decreased during the week and weekend days, while time  surfing on the internet increased on weekdays and weekends. Playing video-games  increased in boys during the weekends. The trend to increase the time spent on  educational activities with a computer during the weekdays and weekends was  accompanied by a reduction of the same activities without using a computer. There  was a trend to increase reading for fun, talking on the phone and total time in  other SB, on weekdays and weekends in boys and girls. Conclusion(s): Spanish boys  tended to increase objectively measured total daily ST. Moreover, SB modalities have  changed in recent years in children, replacing TV viewing by computer use for both  educational and non-educational purposes, as well as by the use of smartphones or  other sedentary activities that does not imply the presence of a screen.

  abstract = {Purpose: To examine the temporal trends of accelerometer-based total daily sedentary time (ST) and self-reported domain-specific sedentary behavior (SB) on weekdays and weekends in Spanish children. Method: A total of 560 (50.53\% girls) children (4th graders) in 2011/12 from 23 Spanish schools and 462 (48.70\% girls) children (4th graders) in 2017/18 from 19 schools across Cadiz participated. Hip-worn accelerometers and questionnaires were used to assess total daily ST and self-reported time in SB modalities, respectively. Results: The objectively measured total daily ST tended to increase in boys on weekdays and weekends. Time spent watching television (TV) decreased during the week and weekend days, while time surfing on the internet increased on weekdays and weekends. Playing video-games increased in boys during the weekends. The trend to increase the time spent on educational activities with a computer during the weekdays and weekends was accompanied by a reduction of the same activities without using a computer. There was a trend to increase reading for fun, talking on the phone and total time in other SB, on weekdays and weekends in boys and girls. Conclusion(s): Spanish boys tended to increase objectively measured total daily ST. Moreover, SB modalities have changed in recent years in children, replacing TV viewing by computer use for both educational and non-educational purposes, as well as by the use of smartphones or other sedentary activities that does not imply the presence of a screen. These findings highlight the need to promote interventions to decrease total daily ST and reduce SB activities.},

However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to 2{$\lambda$}/n, where {$\lambda$} is the real log canonical threshold and n is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.}
